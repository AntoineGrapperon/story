## Feature Roadmap

### Core Features
- 📈 Structural Heatmaps: Map your draft against classic frameworks like Freytag’s Pyramid or the Hero’s Journey.
- 👤 The Codex: An automated character tracker that flags inconsistencies in traits, physical descriptions, and goals across chapters.
- 🎭 Emotional Arc Mapping: Visualizes the "mood" of each scene to identify where the narrative tension peaks or plateaus.
- 🔫 Chekhov’s Gun Detector: Identify "orphan" plot points—items or clues introduced early on that never reach a resolution.
- 🧩 Trope Analysis: Scans for genre-specific clichés and suggests ways to subvert them.
